<b><p>General</p>
</b><p>The mca.exe program is an assembler for the Intel 8748 and 8749 microcomputers. The program runs in MS-DOS, but I intend to compile the program for Windows if and when DOS program support is no longer readily available. The program is run by entering "mca filename" on the DOS command line. If the filename does not include a file extension, the ".asm" extension is automatically appended.</p>
<p>The program generates a work file ".wrk", an error file ".err" and an object code file ".obj" which is written in Intel Hex format. These files are generated each time the program is executed. The 8749 instruction set definitions are contained in the file "mca.txt" and must be loaded each time the program is run. Therefore, mca.txt needs to be located in the same directory as mca.exe.</p>
<b><p>Assembler directives</p>
</b><p>org XXX<br>
neworg XXX</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>These two directives advance the address counter to the location XXX (filing the addresses passed with NOP instructions (0x00). Multiple org and new org statements can be used in the same program. These are useful to avoid conditional jumps across page boundaries or to place look-up tables in specific locations.</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>constant label XX</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>Gives label the value XX</p></dir>
</dir>

<p>include filename</p><dir>
<dir>

<p>Opens filename and begins compiling from this file. Very useful for often used subroutines and look-up tables. The mca.exe program does not support nesting of include files (i.e include files having include files of their own).</p></dir>
</dir>

<b><p>Source code format</p>
</b><p>Constants and labels must be three to eight characters in length. Comments must begin with a semi-colon ";". Look-up tables may be generated by placing a single byte value at the beginning of a series of lines. The program only recognizes numbers in hex format (i.e. 0x00 to 0xffff). It is suggested that source code files be created with "edit", the DOS editor, with tabs set to five spaces. For compatibility with other assemblers, use of constants may be preceded by an immediate indicator "#".</p>
<b><p>License grant</p>
