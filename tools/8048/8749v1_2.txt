Eprommer 8748/49;version 1.2

I worked hard on a piece of hardware that is suitable for a 8748/49
microprocessor. The PCB has been thouroughly tested and should
work fine. 'Type file >lpt1' for print (can take a few minutest).

Have fun,

modifications on version 1.2:
Forgotten 1 diode in scheme. No effect on PCB.

modifications on version 1.1:
Programming an OTP was no problem, however an erasable device could not be
programmed. To solve this problem a resistor of 10 k is needed from
pin 25 (Vpp) to ground.

Some wiring inside the parallelconnector went wrong in the previous
version.

Added scheme and programsource (pascal).
