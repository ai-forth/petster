   All the utilities on this page have been scanned for viruses but, just
   to be safe, you should re-scan them after you download them. I'm not
   responsible for any junk you pick-up off the 'net! Now that the legal
   stuff is out of the way, let's take a look at what we have. All the
   programs listed here are DOS-based and either public domain or
   shareware:
   
   s48v13.zip This is a nice little 8048 simulator. It isn't very fast
   (it won't run in real-time unless you have an extremely fast computer)
   but it does allow you to view registers, set breakpoints, set I/O port
   values and trip an interrupt. It does not allow you to modify
   registers or memory locations.
   tasm_v28.zip TASM is a simple assembler which uses tables to assemble
   code for different microcontrollers including the 8048 family. Tables
   for many different chips are included in this file. This is the
   assembler I use just so I don't have to read the instructions for
   another assembler when I switch between different chips.
   epasm13.zip EPASM is an assembler written specifically for the 8048.

   ps48a12.zip PseudoSam is yet another assembler written specifically
   for the 8048. Contributed by Rudolf Liberda.
   8048dis.zip A disassembler for the 8048 family which includes the
   Borland C source code. Contributed by Rudolf Liberda.
   dasm48.zip Another disassembler which may be a bit more powerful than
   8048dis but does not include source code. Several examples are
   included. Contributed by Rudolf Liberda.

   If you need to build a programmer for the 8048 series EPROMs then you
   would be interested in this text file and the following two zipped
   files:
   
   804xprgr.zip
   8749v1_2.zip
