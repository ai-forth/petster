   The 8048 is an 8-bit embedded controller from Intel. It's old
   technology and can't compete with the newer generations of controllers
   for speed or power. So, why do I like the 8048? For one thing they're
   cheap and I have a bunch of them laying around. And, they are hardly
   useless. They're great for personal robotics or general electronic
   tinkering. But, it's hard to find information on the 'net about them
   so I created "The 8048 Clearing House" to fill the void.
