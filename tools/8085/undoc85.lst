So, just look into paper; old BYTE's or perhaps Dr. Dobb's.
My list says the following:

Hex   8085 Meaning
---------------------
08	SUB HL-BC
10	Shift right HL
18	Rotate right DE
20	RIM	Read Interrupt Mask  [legal 8085, but new from 8080]
28	Add HL and Immidiate nnnn into DE
30	SIM	Set  Interrupt Mask  [legal 8085, but new from 8080]
38	Add SP and Immidiate nnnn into DE

CB	ReSTart on Overflow to 0040h
D9	Load [DE] from HL
DD	Jump on 'Not X5'
ED	Load Hl from [DE]
FD	Jump on 'X5'

greetings, Holger
