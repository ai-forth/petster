Okay, if he MUST use an 8085A, possibly for its serial commands, then here
is the verbal connection list for you.
---------------------------parts-------------------------
IC1 = 8085A
IC2 = 74LS373
IC3 = 74LS42
IC4 = EPROM 2732, or substitute any you like (with connections appropriate)
GND = Vss
Vcc = +5 VDC +/-5%
XTAL = 5 MHz crystal
R1 = 50K ohms 1/4W 5%
R2,3,4 = 10K ohms 1/4W 5%
SW1 = momentary pushbutton Normally Open
D1 = 1N4148 or 1N914
C1 = 1 uF > 12WVDC
-----------------------connections----------------------
GND: IC1-6,7,8,9,10,20,39 IC2-1,10 IC3-8,12 IC4-12(GND) SW1 C1(-)
Vcc: IC1-40 IC2-20 IC3-16 IC4-24(Vcc) R1,R2,3,4 pullups D1(-)
R1:  IC1-36  not Vcc end
R2:  IC1-35  not Vcc end
R3:  IC1-32  not Vcc end
R4:  IC1-31  not Vcc end
D1:  IC1-36  { D1(+) }
C1:  IC1-36  { C1(+) }
XTALpins: IC1-1,2
IC1:28,27,26,25,24,23,22,21 are A15,A14,A13,A12,A11,A10,A9,A8  respectively
IC1:19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12 are D7,D6,D5,D4,D3,D2,D1,D0  respectively
IC1-30  IC2-11
IC1:19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12 are IC2:3,4,7,8,13,14,17,18  respectively
IC2:2,5,6,9,12,15,16,19  are  A7,A6,A5,A4,A3,A2,A1,A0   respectively
IC1-34   IC3-15
IC1-32   IC3-14
IC1-31   IC3-13
IC3:4,6,3,5   are  /IOW, /IOR, /MW, /MR   repectively
IC4:21,19,22,23,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are A11,A10,A9,A8,A7,A6,A5,A4,A3,A2,A1,A0
respectively, if you want to address the EPROM where the 8085 starts
   reading op-codes at 0000Hex or 0000000000000000Binary.

IC4:17,16,15,14,13,11,10,9  are  D7,D6,D5,D4,D3,D2,D1,D0  respectively

 And you can use just the /MR line to IC4-18&20 to enable the EPROM if
that's the only device you are using for memory, but that's kind of dumb,
so why not use another 74LS42, IC5, to detect when the higher address lines
on IC1:28,27,26,25 are zero, and thus select the EPROM, IC4, only when
reading the lowest 4K Bytes? So connect them this way:

IC5:16 to Vcc, 8 to GND, 15 to IC1-28, 14 to IC1-27, 13 to IC1-26,
IC5:12 to IC1-25 and then use IC5-1 to run the IC4-18 (/CE:Chip Enable)
 and use /MR to run the IC4-20 (/OE:Output Enable). Then you will also find
 that you have created an address selector that you have that will at least
 select 10 banks of 4KBytes each for your SRAM chips, such as 2K 6116's or
 such or you can study up on address selectors and settle on your own scheme.

Good luck!
