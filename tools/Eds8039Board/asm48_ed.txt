Yes, that'd be fine.  Thanks.
I've attached new DOS and CP/M versions.

I created the DOS version by passing the CP/M source through
a 8080 to 8086 translator and then manually adjusting what needed
to be changed.  Only took a couple of days.

The DOS version retains the old DOS 1.x style FCB calls.
I've tested it under Win98SE and it works fine.  (I recall
someone once claiming that FCB calls don't work on some
versions of Windows - I don't know which that might be
though.)

If you still remember how to use CP/M ASM then you'll
have no problems using these progs :)

Ed
